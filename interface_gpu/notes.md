# notes

- test effect of d1 strength, d2 strength, dopamine clearance, ionotropic channel conductance, ionotropic neurotransmitter clearance
- two compartment model with various ion channels + point attractor + dopamine
- ring attractor + point attractor + dopamine (for gain modulation)
  - test original ring attractor and adapt it for the new neuron type
- grid attractor (+ point attractor + dopamine) (find github reference or just increase dimensions of ring attractor, make sure it is hexadirectional)
  - use to navigate symbolic vector space as continuous space
- serotonin model or other neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, maybe nitric oxide, etc) (hallucination/learning model?)
- general gpu plasticity impl followed by nb macro impl (cpu + gpu + pyo3)
- toleman eichenbaum machine (tem) (find reference on github as well as paper) (electrical then chemical) (+ dopamine or other neurotransmitter)
- horizontal + vertical control (thousand brains theory + hierarchy + consensus voting) (+ dopamine)

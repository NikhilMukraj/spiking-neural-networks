# notes

- attempt to debug current model with print statements during execution to isolate where nans appear
- see what happens when all weights are 0
- if still cannot debug, combine spike train and izhikevich neuron into one neuronal model and try that
- if that does not work try using LIF (check kernel) instead of izhikevich or rent amd or intel gpu (cudo?)
- two compartment model with ion channels + point attractor + dopamine
- ring attractor + point attractor + dopamine
- grid attractor (+ point attractor + dopamine)
- serotonin model or other neurotransmitter
- general gpu plasticity implementation
- toleman eichenbaum machine (electrical then chemical)
- toleman eichenbaum machine + dopamine

HEALTHY CONTROL SHOULD EXPECT THAT C1 IS DOMINANT AT LOWER DISTORTIONS AND C2 SHOULD TAKE OVER AT HIGHER DISTORTIONS,
C2 SHOULD BE APPLIED AFTER C1 IS APPLIED, psychotic behavior would be c2 taking over at lower and lower distortions,
or c1 should have higher accuracy at lower distortion and c2 should have higher accuracy at high distortion,
c2 should take over when c2 distortion is lower

replot isolated neuron tests with new values ($s_{D_{1}}$ and $s_{D_{2}}$ fitted for physiological conditions, $s_{D_{2}}$ should be 0.5)

# TODO

- [x] try colwise sum on gpu
  - [x] benchmark cpu v gpu
- [ ] then move to getting incoming connections on a basic graph
- [ ] then move to calculating input values given basic graph, voltages, and gap conductance kernel
- [ ] then move to a more advanced graph with a seperate key set
- [ ] benchmark calculation of inputs

# notes

## general

- default ligand gated channel is just neurotransmitter $X$ with ligand gated channel $I_{syn} = g_X r_X (V - E_X)$
- gpu receptors refactor where g, r, E, etc are not shared there's just an indivual r ampa, r nmda, g ampa, g nmda, etc

## todo

- [ ] ion channel defaults
  - [ ] basic gating variables defaults in ion channels
- [ ] if statements (handled by statement blocks)
- [ ] default ligand gated channel
- [ ] neuronal chemical testing
- [ ] kinetics

# notes

may need to optimize spiking neural network by optimizing input equation as a grammar and associated parameters simultaneously
current main performance bottleneck: using mexpr to parse equation and constantly re-tokenizing expr
use matfile, rustfft, ndarray_complex to calculate fouriers on eeg data
